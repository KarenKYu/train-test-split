We do so by training multiple different models and evaluating how each performs on a holdout set.  With each model that we attempt and then evaluate based on the holdout set, we increase the chance of finding a model that performs well because it matches the randomness in the holdout set data.  To correct for this, we split our data into three groups.  The first group is for training, the second group is for comparing models, and the third set is for evaluating how well our chosen model will perform on data it (nor us) have previously seen."
