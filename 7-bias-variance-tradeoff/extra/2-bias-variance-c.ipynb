However, at a certain point these improved scores on our training set are due to the models fitting to randomness in the data that is unlikely to generalize.  We see this, when by adding more parameters the performance on the holdout set gets worse.  This displays overfitting to the training set.  To combat against overfitting, we choose the model that performs best on the holdout set."
